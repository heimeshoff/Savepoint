# Plan Skill

Use when: PROJECT.md exists and user wants to start building

## Process
1. Read PROJECT.md for context
2. Extract requirements, categorize as v1/v2/out-of-scope
3. Create phases (2-4 max) that deliver v1
4. Present roadmap for approval
5. Create .planning/REQUIREMENTS.md and .planning/ROADMAP.md
6. Initialize .planning/STATE.md

## Execution
Use Claude's native /plan and /task for actual execution.
Update STATE.md after completing work.
