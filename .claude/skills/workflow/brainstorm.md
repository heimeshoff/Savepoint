# Brainstorm Skill

Use when: User wants to explore an idea before implementation

## Process
1. Ask clarifying questions (don't write code yet):
   - What problem does this solve?
   - Who is the user?
   - What does success look like?
   - What are the constraints?
   - What is explicitly OUT of scope?

2. Present understanding in small chunks (3-5 bullets)
3. Ask: "Is this accurate? What am I missing?"
4. Repeat until user confirms
5. Create/update .planning/PROJECT.md

## Key Principle
Understand BEFORE implementing. No code until spec is clear.
